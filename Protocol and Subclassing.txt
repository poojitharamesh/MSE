PROTOCOL:
	Objective-C was extended at NeXT to introduce the concept of multiple inheritance of specification, but not 
implementation, through the introduction of protocols.

1)Objective-C allows you to define protocols, which declare the methods expected to be used for a particular situation. 
2)A protocol is used to declare methods and properties that are independent of any specific class.
3)Protocol can include declarations of both instance methods and class methods, as well as properties.
4)By default, all methods declared in a protocol are required methods.
5)Protocols inherit from other protocols.
6)Protocols are also useful in situations where the class of an object isn’t known, or needs to stay hidden.



SUBCLASS:

1)A subclass inherits methods and instance variables from its superclass.
2)A subclass can override a method it inherits from the class it is based on.The class it is based on is called its 
   superclass.
3)Some objects have default methods and settings that may not be suitable for your needs.  By creating a custom subclass, 
  you can set your interface elements to inherit qualities according to your criteria, not just from the object's default 
  class implementation.
